Hello.  There's nothing here.  Apparently Google thinks this page should exist because it still remembers something from Barker's old site.  So I put something here.  I suppose I was wrong about there being nothing here.  More accurate to say that there WAS nothing here, but now there is.  What's here is nothing, though.

How about that Cracky-chan?  Cute and sweet, right?

Now that there's something here, maybe it'll stop showing up as a 4O4 on my Google Search Console.  Does that zero look a bit suspicious to you?  Good catch.  I don't want to mention the number, again, because Google.
